- Get a VPS
- Download VS Code
- Install MetaTrader 5 Terminal (Portable Mode Recommended):
On the VPS, open a browser.
1.Download MT5 from meta quotes.
2.When installing, do NOT use the default location.
3.Choose a custom folder like: C:\MQ45\MetaTrader5\
4.Check “Yes” when it asks to run in portable mode, or install it manually by running in CMD: "C:\MQ45\Metatrader5\terminal64.exe" /portable or
1.Right-click terminal64.exe or its shortcut → Create Shortcut
2.Right-click the shortcut → Properties
3.In the Target field, add /portable at the end:
"C:\MQ45\Metatrader5\terminal64.exe" /portable
Portable mode keeps config/data in the same folder. This makes it easier to manage multiple sessions or terminals later.

NB: Copy the server.dat file from the config folder from other sources to have broker list

- Install Python (check in terminal if python --version and pip --version exists, ensure it is added to PATH)
and MetaTrader5 Package by running "pip install MetaTrader5" in terminal:
1.Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2.Use Python 3.10 or newer.
3.During setup, check “Add Python to PATH”.
4.After install, open Command Prompt and run: pip install MetaTrader5
✅ This gives you access to the MetaTrader5 Python API that connects to the installed terminal.

- Install nodejs

write the scripts in C:\MQ45\scripts
write the api in C:\MQ45\api


- if you can't access VPS from remote:
Open "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security"
Create a New Inbound Rule: In the left pane → click Inbound Rules → In the right pane → click New Rule…

Create a .bat File
This helps if you need to run the script with arguments, virtual env, or specific paths.
Create a file called run_mt_script.bat with contents like:
"@echo off
cd C:\Path\To\Your\Script
python verify_participation.py

✅ Step 3: Set Up Windows Task Scheduler
Open Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc from Run or Start Menu)
Click "Create Basic Task…"
Give it a name like Run MT5 Script Every 5 Mins
Choose Daily
Set the Start time (e.g., 00:00 or any time)
Choose Repeat Task Every 5 minutes for a duration of 1 day (we’ll fine-tune this later)
In "Action", select Start a Program
For Program/script, enter:
C:\Path\To\run_mt_script.bat
(or use python.exe if you're passing script directly)
Click Finish
✅ Step 4: Fine-Tune the Trigger (Advanced Settings)
After creating the task, double-click it in Task Scheduler
Go to Triggers → Edit
Set: Repeat task every: 5 minutes
Set: For a duration of: 1 day
Make sure Enabled is checked
Go to Settings tab:
Check Allow task to be run on demand
Check Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed
Optionally uncheck Stop the task if it runs longer than... (or increase duration)
Click OK
